# Summary
The objective of this project is to construct a robust predictive model for individual voter turnout in the upcoming November US presidential election, leveraging data sourced from the Cooperative Election Study (CCES). This endeavor aims to accurately forecast whether voters will participate in the election, facilitating targeted outreach initiatives by a non-partisan advocacy group to increase voter turnout among less-engaged demographics. Employing advanced machine learning techniques such as XGBoost and Ranger, the study addressed inherent challenges such as imbalanced data and the intricate characteristics of the dataset. Key methodologies included preprocessing the dataset using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) to handle missing data effectively, and employing SHAP analysis to select relevant features critical for model prediction and interpretation.

The algorithm evaluation prioritized metrics such as recall, F1 score, and Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve (PR-AUC), focusing on the models' capacity to accurately predict non-voters. Following meticulous tuning, XGBoost emerged with a recall of 0.82 and PR-AUC of 0.83, underscoring its effectiveness in identifying individuals less likely to participate in voting.

This study showcases the practical application of machine learning in electoral forecasting, offering actionable insights for electoral campaigns and policy initiatives aimed at increasing voter engagement. Future research could further refine these methods to improve predictive accuracy across diverse electoral contexts and demographic groups.
